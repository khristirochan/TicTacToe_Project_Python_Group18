# Title : Tic Tac Toe Game 
### Language : Python
### Tool : Jupyter
<p> We have implement a project on Tic Tac Toe GUI with Python. This game is very popular and is quite simple in itself. It is a two-player game. In this game, there is a board with 3×3 squares and a player marks one of the 3×3 squares with his symbol (perhaps “X” or “O”) and he aims to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions one is to Create a straight line before your opponent to win the game or Prevent his opponent from creating a straight line first.</p>
<p>To implements this, we have used 9 button in grid layout to make 3x3 squere, used labels and messagebox to display messages.</p>
